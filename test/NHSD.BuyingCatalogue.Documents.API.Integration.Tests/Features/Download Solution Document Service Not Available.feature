Feature:  Download an existing file when the storage service is not available
    As the BuyingCatalogueService
    I want to make GET document download requests for a solution's file
    So that I make sure the contents of that file are correct

Background:
    Given There are files in the blob storage
        | SolutionId | FileNames |
        | sol1       | File1.txt |

Scenario: Azure blob storage is not available
    Given the blob storage service is down
    When a GET 'File1.txt' document request is made for solution sol1
    Then a response with status code 500 is returned
